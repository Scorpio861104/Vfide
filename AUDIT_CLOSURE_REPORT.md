# VFIDE Audit Closure Report

**Date:** 2026-05-14
**Snapshot:** `Vfide-main__20_.zip`
**Audit scope:** Phase 1 (Solidity), Phase 2 (Backend/API), Phase 3 (Frontend)

## Headline scoreline

| Severity | Total | Closed | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Critical** | 7 | 7 | All resolved |
| **High** | 62 | 62 | 38 P1 + 17 P2 + 7 P3 |
| **Medium** | 71 | 71 | 37 P1 + 29 P2 + 5 P3 |
| **Low** | 56 | 56 | 22 P1 + 32 P2 + 2 P3 |
| **Total** | **196** | **196** | |

"Closed" is used in the standard audit sense: each finding has either been fixed in code, deferred behind a documented gate (e.g. moved to `contracts/future/`), accepted as design with rationale, or rendered moot by removal of the targeted code path. No finding has been silently ignored.

## Disposition breakdown

### Phase 1 — Solidity (90 findings)

- **Criticals (7):** all fixed in code. Highlights:
  - C-1 `VFIDEToken._transfer` vault-to-owner resolution bug
  - C-2 missing CI compilation gate (now an 11-job GitHub Actions pipeline)
  - C-3 `Seer.getScoreAt()` zero-history fallback bypassing DAO vote weight freeze
- **Highs (38):** mix of fixes + non-custody-driven design decisions. Highlights:
  - H-01/H-32 auto-vault 30-day lockout — kept by design (warning hooks only, per non-custody)
  - H-03 `SystemHandover` `MAX_DISARMS = 1`, `disarmCount`, 7-day `ARM_TIMESTAMP_WINDOW`
  - H-17 TermLoan guarantor standing approval — intentional commitment semantics
  - H-31 MerchantPortal dual-path (pull permit + signed intent) — both paths coexist by design
- **Mediums (37):** 12 fixed before this session, 5 fixed this session (M-12, M-21, M-22, M-24, M-33), 4 inapplicable to current code, 3 accepted-design per non-custody (M-13 single arbiter, M-15 no cross-loan guarantor cap, M-27 no per-tx pull cap — all flagged), 9 deferred to `contracts/future/`, 4 closed by file deletion (M-09, M-19, M-20, M-25).
- **Lows (22):** 14 fixed/deleted/deferred, 8 accepted-design (cosmetic, naming, or non-blocking liveness).

### Phase 2 — Backend / API (74 findings)

- **Highs (17):** all closed. Notable:
  - P2-H-02 Redis required in production (no in-memory rate-limit fallback)
  - P2-H-11 `instrumentation.ts` runs `validateEnvironment` on every Node runtime boot
  - P2-H-13 session-key client code triage settled per the `AUDIT_FINDINGS_RUNNING_TODO.md` docs/security record
  - P2-H-14 `lib/auth/validation.ts` removed
- **Mediums (29):** 26 verified clean in the v20 snapshot, 1 fixed this session (P2-M-12 — note: file was already correct in-place; my prior session's edit added a duplicate import which has now been cleaned up), 1 accepted-design (P2-M-02 UA binding is UX-hostile but not security-broken), 1 covered by an upstream P2-H fix (P2-M-15 via P2-H-02).
- **Lows (32):** all addressed (mix of fixed, deleted, deferred to dev-only config gating, accepted).

### Phase 3 — Frontend (32 findings)

- **Highs (7):** all closed. Most resolved by removal of orphan modules (embedded wallet, VerifyTab, SEO JSON-LD subsystem).
- **Mediums (5):** all addressed — 4 by removal of dangerous orphan code, 1 by switching `lib/crypto.ts:271` to `crypto.randomUUID()`.
- **Lows (2):** both fixed by removal (`components/seo/` deleted; `lib/crypto.ts` `disconnectWallet` is now an intentional no-op with `vfide_*` key-prefix consistency throughout).

## Files modified this session

| Path | Findings addressed |
|---|---|
| `contracts/SystemHandover.sol` | H-03 (`MAX_DISARMS`, `disarmCount`, `ARM_TIMESTAMP_WINDOW`) |
| `contracts/PRODUCTION_SET.md` | + `CardBoundVaultDeployer`, + Per-Vault Auxiliary section |
| `contracts/VaultHub.sol` | H-01 NatSpec design-intent block on `ensureVault` |
| `contracts/MerchantPortal.sol` | H-31 + H-32 NatSpec on `processPayment` |
| `contracts/VFIDETermLoan.sol` | H-17 NatSpec on `signAsGuarantor` |
| `contracts/VFIDEToken.sol` | Aligned `_enforceSeerAction` with DAO behavior + `SeerWarned` event |
| `contracts/SharedInterfaces.sol` | M-12 (`acceptOwnership` invalidates pending emergency-controller / owner) |
| `contracts/PayrollManager.sol` | M-21 (`MAX_PAUSE_DURATION = 30 days`, payee unilateral resume), M-22 (`setRate` emits Seer reward) |
| `contracts/ServicePool.sol` | M-24 (`MAX_PAYOUT_CEILING = 1_000_000 ether` bound) |
| `contracts/EmergencyControl.sol` | M-33 (`_applyRemoveMember` clamps threshold + `ThresholdChanged` event) |
| `app/api/privacy/delete/route.ts` | P2-M-12 was already fixed pre-session; this session cleaned a duplicate import that I had previously introduced |

All 9 modified Solidity files compile clean against solc 0.8.30 (0 errors, 7 pre-existing warnings).

## Accepted-design positions (worth a final re-read before mainnet)

These are the items where the audit recommended a change and we deliberately did not make it. Each is documented inline; this is just the consolidated list for governance review.

1. **H-01/H-32** — Auto-vault creation followed by 30-day key-loss exposure if the user never sets guardians. Same risk surface as an unguardian'd EOA. Kept per the non-custody principle ("users get warnings and bear the risk if they don't act").
2. **H-17** — Term-loan guarantor's signature *is* the standing approval; no per-disbursement re-sign. Intentional.
3. **H-31** — MerchantPortal supports both `merchantPullPermit` (tap-to-pay) and `executePayMerchant(intent, signature)` (sign-per-payment). Both paths active in production by design.
4. **M-13** — Single arbiter for disputes. Multi-arbiter routing would require trust-graded arbiter selection and add governance surface.
5. **M-15** — No cross-loan guarantor exposure cap. A single address can guarantee unbounded loan volume. Per non-custody, capping requires custodial bookkeeping the protocol intentionally doesn't do.
6. **M-27** — No per-tx pull cap on the merchant pull-permit path. The signed permit *is* the cap declaration; adding a separate cap risks UX surprises ("why was my approved payment rejected?").
7. **L-12** — `seer.punish` in `VFIDETermLoan` wrapped in `try/catch {} catch {}`. Silent failure is intentional for liveness — a Seer outage must not block loan-lifecycle progress. Off-chain indexers can detect missed punishments via timestamp gaps; an explicit `PunishmentSkipped` event was considered but rejected as it would not actually improve recovery.
8. **L-16** — `EscrowManager.raiseDispute` has no fee or reputation stake. A dispute fee would deter legitimate disputes from low-balance users; reputation-staking adds attack surface around dispute-spam vs. legitimate-grievance discrimination.
9. **L-17** — Merchant `totalVolume` is gross, not net of refunds. Trust-tier inputs prefer a stable, append-only metric to one that can be manipulated by accomplices initiating refunds.
10. **L-21** — `EmergencyControl.approveRecovery` supermajority is `memberCount > 1 ? memberCount - 1 : 1`. For a 2-member committee, this is 1-of-2. Keeping recovery live for small committees is preferred to a fixed minimum that would brick recovery during attrition.
11. **L-22** — `refreshRecoveryEpoch` is DAO-only by design. DAO oversight of stale proposals is the intended governance surface, not an oversight.
12. **P2-M-02** — `Authorization` token binding to `User-Agent` was recommended; we kept it unbound. UA binding is user-hostile (every browser update breaks sessions) and provides no real security benefit against any threat model that already has the token.

## Deferred (not in V1 mainnet deploy set)

The following contracts live under `contracts/future/` and are excluded from the mainnet deploy plan:

- `VFIDEBridge.sol`
- `MainstreamPayments.sol`
- `SeerAutonomous.sol`, `SeerGuardian.sol`, `SeerSocial.sol`
- `CouncilElection.sol`, `CouncilSalary.sol`, `CouncilManager.sol`
- `SubscriptionManager.sol`
- `BadgeManager.sol`
- `VFIDEEnterpriseGateway.sol`, `VFIDEBenefits.sol`
- `BridgeSecurityModule.sol`

Audit findings against these files (P1-M-10, M-17, M-18, M-28, M-29, M-30, M-31, M-34, M-37, and several Lows) are tracked as "deferred — fix before deploying the relevant phase."

## What's authoritatively true after this campaign

- Every audit finding has a documented disposition.
- Every contract Vanta touched compiles clean against solc 0.8.30.
- Non-custody is preserved: no freeze, no blacklist, no force-recovery, no SecurityHub locks remain in any contract on the mainnet deploy path.
- The security architecture is `proxy.ts` at root (not `middleware.ts`); `validate-frontend-ready.ts` guards against accidental regression.
- The Howey-safe fee-funded payment system (`FeeDistributor` → 5 channels via abstract `ServicePool` work-for-pay) is wired correctly with bounds (`MAX_PAYOUT_CEILING`, `MAX_PAUSE_DURATION`, etc.).
- Backend security baseline: Redis required in prod, strict env validation on boot, structured error sanitization on the API surface, RLS scoped to authenticated address, audit logging on privileged actions, Sentry header scrubbing, CSPRNG everywhere.

The audit phase is complete. Outstanding work is now deployment-readiness, not security-completeness — see `MAINNET_DEPLOY_READINESS.md` for the next checklist.
