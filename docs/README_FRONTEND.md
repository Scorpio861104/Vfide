# VFIDE Frontend

The VFIDE frontend is a Next.js App Router application (TypeScript + React + Tailwind) that powers wallet-connected protocol experiences across finance, commerce, social, governance, and security route groups.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm (or equivalent)
- A wallet for Web3 flows (MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, or WalletConnect-enabled wallet)

### Install

```bash
npm install
```

### Environment

1. Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local`.
2. Fill RPC and app environment values.
3. Configure `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID` only when WalletConnect is required.

### Run

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Build

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Web3 Integration

### Provider Architecture

- `CoreProviders` (`lib/providers/CoreProviders.tsx`) handles non-Web3 app shell concerns.
- `Web3Providers` (`lib/providers/Web3Providers.tsx`) is mounted in wallet-enabled route groups and owns:
  - `WagmiProvider` (with reconnect-on-mount)
  - `QueryClientProvider`
  - `RainbowKitProvider`
  - `SecurityProvider`
  - `useWalletPersistence` lifecycle behavior

This avoids loading wallet state globally on route groups that do not need Web3.

### Networks and Connectors

- Mainnets: Base, Polygon, zkSync Era
- Testnets: Base Sepolia, Polygon Amoy, zkSync Sepolia
- Connectors: injected providers (EIP-6963), MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, optional WalletConnect

### ABI Source of Truth

- Frontend ABIs live in `lib/abis/`.
- Import from `lib/abis/index.ts` rather than reading ABI JSON files directly.
- ABI index normalizes both plain ABI arrays and artifact-style objects.

## Development Notes

- Use TypeScript for all new UI and hook code.
- Keep route-group provider boundaries intact; avoid introducing duplicate `WagmiProvider` trees.
- Prefer existing hooks/components over creating parallel wallet-connect implementations.
- Preserve wallet-gate behavior in route groups that require connection.
